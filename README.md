Welcome to this repository!
This is a Multi layer perceptron model with 1 hidden layer  which predicts the steering angle based on the input image of the road you feed to it.
(Baby step towards autonomous driving?! LOL)

``The model has been built entirely using Numpy and Python without any use of any 3rd party ML libraries``
